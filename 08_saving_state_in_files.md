# State: Files

Files on disk are the original database.

# File Tech

NodeJS is good at files.

The built-in `fs` and `path` libraries have some slick and efficient ways of reading and writing files.

Rather than go through the full API, it's best to look at sample code like that inside the [Express Blog Codealong](/lessons/server-side-js-track/blog)  ([github repo](https://github.com/BurlingtonCodeAcademy/express-blog))

> Remember that most of Node's I/O functions are asynchronous, so you may need to use callbacks, Promises, and/or async-await.

they will stay there for a while, but will disappear when your server restarts

...so for apps on Heroku at least, we need a better solution for storing data long-term
